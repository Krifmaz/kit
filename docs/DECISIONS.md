# Decisions

One line per non-obvious call (DESIGN.md first, then Encore's behaviour, then common sense).

- 2026-11-04 · The design docs went straight to main as the first commit, since an empty repo has no base for a PR; everything after goes through PRs.
- 2026-11-04 · Tokens keep Android's current differences from the web (logo accent in every palette, cream OLED text, charcoal accent on Light) as `compose.overrides`, so the generated Compose theme equals Encore's exactly.
- 2026-11-04 · The generated CSS is only the theme-variable blocks of Encore's app.css (lines 1–72); the rest of the stylesheet stays Encore's and is reused unchanged by kit-leptos.
- 2026-11-04 · The notice contract keeps Encore's object ({ok, text, checking}) and adds `id` and `severity`; Encore keeps its paths, other apps get `/api/notices`.
- 2026-11-04 · Diagnostics keeps Encore's check shape ({name, kind, ok, detail, request}) and adds optional `status` and `fix`.
- 2026-11-04 · The kit's release workflow makes no release until docs/releases/0.1.0.md exists, so the first tag is v0.1.0 once §18 passes.
- 2026-11-04 · rustfmt max_width 140 (Encore's code is written to long lines; fmt is now enforced in CI).
- 2026-11-04 · Package names: Rust crates `kit-*`; Android `dev.krifmaz.kit:kit-compose` (as DESIGN.md §15).
